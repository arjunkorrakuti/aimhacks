Aimhacks created as a high-school project among four friends - @arjunkorrakuti, @arinb45, @MichaelTS2007, and @ArnavSinha0511 - is orignally based on Khan Academy's fork of ProcessingJS. Then using a boilerplate which converts the fork into normal processing, the game is turned into an HTML-based webpage. The game stays very simple and lightweight while testing the players "aiming" skill in various ways. You can play the game at https://arjunkorrakuti.github.io/aimhacks. Below are some screenshots taken of the gameplay.
